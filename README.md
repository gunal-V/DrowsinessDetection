# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

## Overview
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a project aimed at enhancing road safety by identifying signs of drowsiness in drivers. The system uses a pre-trained model from the dlib library along with OpenCV to monitor and assess a driver's eye state, raising an alert if drowsiness is detected. By analyzing eye movements and other facial cues, this system can effectively determine when a driver may be losing alertness, reducing the risk of accidents caused by fatigue.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Analyzes driver’s facial features in real-time to detect signs of drowsiness.
- **Eye Blink Detection**: Utilizes pre-trained models to monitor eye blinks and assess alertness.
- **Alert Mechanism**: Triggers an alert if drowsiness is detected, notifying the driver to take a break.
- **Python-based Implementation**: Built using Python libraries such as dlib and OpenCV for image processing and model-based detection.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Programming language used to implement the detection logic.
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing and real-time detection.
- **dlib**: Provides pre-trained models for facial feature detection.
